Community-Based Pollution & Climate Reporting Platform

A Minor Project submitted at:

Department of Computer Science and Engineering

🧩 Overview

Climate Connect is a simple, user-friendly web application that helps people report and visualize pollution or climate-related incidents in their local area.

The platform promotes awareness, transparency, and community participation by enabling the public to share real-time environmental data. This helps authorities, NGOs, and communities better understand and respond to pollution levels.

🧠 Problem Statement

Environmental pollution and local climate changes often go unnoticed due to the absence of a public reporting system.
Without real-time, geotagged data, it becomes difficult for responsible organizations to take timely and effective action.

💡 Our Solution: Climate Connect

Climate Connect acts as a bridge between the community and environmental organizations.

Users can:

📸 Report pollution incidents with photos and live location data

🗺 View reports on an interactive real-time map

📊 Analyze patterns and get basic insights into regional pollution trends

This system encourages citizen participation and helps track environmental issues at the ground level.

⚡ Key Features

📸 Report Pollution Easily – Upload a photo, short description, and your location

🗺 Live Interactive Map – Displays all reports with map markers

🧠 AI-Based Detection (Basic) – Identifies possible pollution in images using TensorFlow.js

🔍 Filter & Search – Find reports by pollution type or region

🔐 User Authentication – Sign up or log in to submit and manage reports

📊 User Dashboard – View, edit, and track your own submissions
