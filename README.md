🌍 Climate Connect – Community-Based
Pollution & Climate Reporting Platform
A Minor Project submitted at Lakshmi Narain College of Technology Excellence
(LNCTE)
Guided by respected faculty under the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering


🧩 Overview
Climate Connect is a simple and user-friendly web application designed to help people report
and visualize pollution or climate-related incidents in their area.
It aims to increase awareness, transparency, and action by allowing the public to share data
that can help communities and organizations understand real-time pollution levels.


🧠 Problem Statement
Environmental pollution and climate changes often go unnoticed at the local level, especially
when there is no public reporting system.
Lack of real-time, geotagged data makes it difficult for authorities or NGOs to take early action.


💡 Our Solution: Climate Connect
Climate Connect acts as a bridge between the community and environmental organizations.
Users can:
● Report pollution incidents with photos and location data.
● View all reports on a live interactive map.
● Get basic insights into pollution patterns in their region.
This platform promotes community participation and helps track environmental issues at the
ground level.


⚡ Key Features
● 📸 Report Pollution Easily: Upload a photo, short description, and your location.
● 🗺️ Live Map: Shows all reports using an interactive map with markers.
● 🧠 AI-Based Detection (Basic): Identifies possible pollution from images using a
lightweight machine learning model.
● 🔍 Filter and Search: Find reports by type or region.
● 🔐 User Accounts: Simple sign-up and login for authenticated reporting.
● 📊 Dashboard: Users can manage their own submitted reports.
